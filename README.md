- 👋 Hi, I’m @IreneRAnthony
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript and React mainly, though I am trying to branch out on more libraries and tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about JavaScript, React, Redux, and just trying to get a solid foundation for these languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open sourced projects that could maybe use an extra hand at some detailed work.
- 📫 You can reach me either on here, or just send me a message if you want to connect by email instead.
